# GoLang Study Repository

This is my GoLang study repository! This is where I'll be sharing my journey as I learn GoLang and practice coding in it. Feel free to explore the different folders and files to see my progress and the concepts I'm working on.

## Folder Structure

- **Basics**: This folder contains my beginner-level GoLang programs. These programs cover fundamental concepts such as variables, loops, and conditional statements.

- **Data Structures**: In this folder, you'll find more complex GoLang programs that delve into topics like algorithms, data structures, and error handling.

- **Projects**: Here, I'll showcase larger projects that I've built using GoLang. These projects might involve web development, APIs, or other practical applications.

## Contributions and Feedback

I'm open to suggestions, feedback, and collaborations! If you spot any mistakes in my code or have ideas to improve it, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
